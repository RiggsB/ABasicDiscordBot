# ABasicDiscordBot
A simple bot for use in Discord servers made using the Discord.py library.

Commands:
  bb$8ball : Answers a yes/no question. Works just like a classic magic eight ball.
  
  bb$guess : Prompts the message author to guess a number between 1 and 10, then replies as to whether or not the user's guess was
             correct.
  
  bb$square : Returns the squared value of the user-provided number
  
  bb$hello : Prompts the bot to return the message author's friendly greeting
  
  bb$ping : Simple means of checking bot response times. This command does not return actual response time or ping measured in ms.
  
  bb$btc : Returns the current value of bitcoin in USD.


Basic Bot logs a list of all servers it is currently connected to on launch and every 20 minutes thereafter.
